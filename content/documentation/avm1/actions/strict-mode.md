The field `isStrict` corresponds to the boolean `isStrict != 0`.

**TODO**: Confirm if padding is allowed.

# Description

This AVM1 action only serves as a hint that the byte code was compiled using
"strict mode". It has no runtime effect.

I assume this corresponds that the program type-checked.
This hint was probably envisioned as a signal to improve performance by relying
on the compile-time checks and reducing runtime checks, but in practice it did
not work out: AS2 type hints are optional so passing a "strict compilation"
does not mean much.

I only found references to this action in other parsers (Gnash and Shumway), but
wasn't able to generate it myself. I looked for a "strict compilation" in the
editors "Macromedia Flash 8" and "Adobe Flash Pro CS6" but couldn't find it.

# Abstract AS2

```
@strictCompilationHint(); // Default: `true`
@strictCompilationHint(true);
@strictCompilationHint(false);
```
